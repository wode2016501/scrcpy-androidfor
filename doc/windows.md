## Run

_Make sure that your device meets the [prerequisites](/README.md#prerequisites)._

Scrcpy is a command line application: it is mainly intended to be executed from
a terminal with command line arguments.

To open a terminal at the expected location, double-click on
`open_a_terminal_here.bat` in your scrcpy directory, then type your command. For
example, without arguments:

```bash
scrcpy
```

or with arguments (here to disable audio and record to `file.mkv`):

```
scrcpy --no-audio --record=file.mkv
```

Documentation for command line arguments is available:
 - `scrcpy --help`
 - on [github](/README.md)

To start scrcpy directly without opening a terminal, double-click on one of
these files:
 - `scrcpy-console.bat`: start with a terminal open (it will close when scrcpy
   terminates, unless an error occurs);
 - `scrcpy-noconsole.vbs`: start without a terminal (but you won't see any error
   message).

_Avoid double-clicking on `scrcpy.exe` directly: on error, the terminal would
close immediately and you won't have time to read any error message (this
executable is intended to be run from the terminal). Use `scrcpy-console.bat`
instead._

If you plan to always use the same arguments, create a file `myscrcpy.bat`
(enable [show file extensions] to avoid confusion) containing your command, For
example:

```bash
scrcpy --prefer-text --turn-screen-off --stay-awake
```

[show file extensions]: https://www.howtogeek.com/205086/beginner-how-to-make-windows-show-file-extensions/

Then just double-click on that file.

You could also edit (a copy of) `scrcpy-console.bat` or `scrcpy-noconsole.vbs`
to add some arguments.
